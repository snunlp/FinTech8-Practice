        "The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are _encoder-decoder_ models, which commonly use a _recurrent neural network_ (RNN) to _encode_ the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a _context vector_. We can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the entire input sentence. This vector is then _decoded_ by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating it one word at a time.\n",

        "The above image shows an example translation. The input/source sentence, \"guten morgen\", is passed through the embedding layer (yellow) and then input into the encoder (green). We also append a _start of sequence_ (`<sos>`) and _end of sequence_ (`<eos>`) token to the start and end of sentence, respectively. At each time-step, the input to the encoder RNN is both the embedding, $e$, of the current word, $e(x_t)$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $h_{t-1}$, and the encoder RNN outputs a new hidden state $h_t$. We can think of the hidden state as a vector representation of the sentence so far. The RNN can be represented as a function of both of $e(x_t)$ and $h_{t-1}$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$h_t = \\text{EncoderRNN}(e(x_t), h_{t-1})$$\n",

        "We're using the term RNN generally here, it could be any recurrent architecture, such as an _LSTM_ (Long Short-Term Memory) or a _GRU_ (Gated Recurrent Unit).\n",

        "Here, we have $X = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_T\\}$, where $x_1 = \\text{<sos>}, x_2 = \\text{guten}$, etc. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is usually either initialized to zeros or a learned parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the final word, $x_T$, has been passed into the RNN via the embedding layer, we use the final hidden state, $h_T$, as the context vector, i.e. $h_T = z$. This is a vector representation of the entire source sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we have our context vector, $z$, we can start decoding it to get the output/target sentence, \"good morning\". Again, we append start and end of sequence tokens to the target sentence. At each time-step, the input to the decoder RNN (blue) is the embedding, $d$, of current word, $d(y_t)$, as well as the hidden state from the previous time-step, $s_{t-1}$, where the initial decoder hidden state, $s_0$, is the context vector, $s_0 = z = h_T$, i.e. the initial decoder hidden state is the final encoder hidden state. Thus, similar to the encoder, we can represent the decoder as:\n",

        "$$s_t = \\text{DecoderRNN}(d(y_t), s_{t-1})$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the input/source embedding layer, $e$, and the output/target embedding layer, $d$, are both shown in yellow in the diagram they are two different embedding layers with their own parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the decoder, we need to go from the hidden state to an actual word, therefore at each time-step we use $s_t$ to predict (by passing it through a `Linear` layer, shown in purple) what we think is the next word in the sequence, $\\hat{y}_t$.\n",

We always use `<sos>` for the first input to the decoder, $y_1$, but for subsequent inputs, $y_{t>1}$, we will sometimes use the actual, ground truth next word in the sequence, $y_t$ and sometimes use the word predicted by our decoder, $\\hat{y}_{t-1}$. This is called _teacher forcing_, see a bit more info about it [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/teacher-forcing-for-recurrent-neural-networks/).\n",
        "\n",
        "When training/testing our model, we always know how many words are in our target sentence, so we stop generating words once we hit that many. During inference it is common to keep generating words until the model outputs an `<eos>` token or after a certain amount of words have been generated.\n",

        "### Vocabularies\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we'll build the _vocabulary_ for the source and target languages. The vocabulary is used to associate each unique token in our dataset with an index (an integer), e.g. \"hello\" = 1, \"world\" = 2, \"bye\" = 3, \"hates\" = 4, etc. When feeding text data to our model, we convert the string into tokens and then the tokens into numbers using the vocabulary as a look up table, e.g. \"hello world\" becomes `[\"hello\", \"world\"]` which becomes `[1, 2]` using the example indices given. We do this as neural networks cannot operate on strings, only numerical values.\n",
        "\n",
        "We create the vocabulary (one for each language) from our datasets using the `build_vocab_from_iterator` function, provided by `torchtext`, which accepts an iterator where each item is a list of tokens. It then counts up the number of unique tokens and assigns each a numerical value.\n",
        "\n",
        "In theory, our vocabulary can be large enough to have an index for every unique token in our dataset. However, what happens if a token exists in our validation and test set, but not in our training set? In that case, we replace the token with an \"unknown token\", denoted by `<unk>`, which is given its own index (usually index zero). All unknown tokens are replaced by `<unk>`, even if the tokens are different, i.e. if the tokens \"gilgamesh\" and \"enkidu\" were both not within our vocabulary, then the string \"gilgamesh hates enkidu\" gets tokenized to `[\"gilgamesh\", \"hates\", \"enkidu\"]` and then becomes `[0, 24, 0]` (where \"hates\" has the index 24).\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, we want our model to be able to handle unknown tokens by learning to use the context around them to make translations. The only way it can learn that is if we also have unknown tokens in the training set. Hence, when creating our vocabularies with `build_vocab_from_iterator`, we use the `min_freq` argument to not create an index for tokens which appear less than `min_freq` times in our training set. In other words, when using the vocabulary, any token which does not appear at least twice in our training set will get replaced by the unknown token index when converting tokens to indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that a vocabulary should only be built from the training set and never the validation or test set. This prevents \"information leakage\" into our model, giving us artifically inflated validation/test scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also use the `specials` argument of `build_vocab_from_iterator` to pass _special tokens_. These are tokens which we want to add to the vocabulary but do not necessarily appear in our tokenized examples. These special tokens will appear first in the vocabulary. We've already discussed the `unk_token`, `sos_token`, and `eos_token`. The final special token is the `pad_token`, denoted by `<pad>`.\n",
        "\n",
        "When inputting sentences into our model, it is more efficient to pass multiple sentences at once (known as a batch), instead of one at a time. The requirement for sentences to be batched together is that they all have to be the same length (in terms of the number of tokens). The majority of our sentences are not the same length, but we can solve this by \"padding\" (adding `<pad>` tokens) the tokenized version of each sentence in a batch until they all have equal tokens to the longest sentence in the batch. For example, if we had two sentences: \"I love pizza\" and \"I hate music videos\". They would be tokenized to something like: `[\"i\", \"love\", \"pizza\"]` and `[\"i\", \"hate\", \"music\", \"videos\"]`. The first sequence of tokens would then be padded to `[\"i\", \"love\", \"pizza\", \"<pad>\"]`. Both sequences could then be converted to indexes using the vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "That was a lot of information, but luckily `torchtext` handles all the fuss of building the vocabulary. We'll handle the padding and batching later.\n"

Then, similar to the encoder, we pass through an embedding layer and apply dropout. This batch of embedded tokens is then passed into the RNN with the previous hidden and cell states. This produces an `output` (hidden state from the top layer of the RNN), a new `hidden` state (one for each layer, stacked on top of each other) and a new `cell` state (also one per layer, stacked on top of each other). We then pass the `output` (after getting rid of the sentence length dimension) through the linear layer to receive our `prediction`.

Using the `nn.LSTMCell` in this case would mean we don't have to `unsqueeze` to add a fake sequence length dimension, but we would need one `nn.LSTMCell` per layer in the decoder and to ensure each `nn.LSTMCell` receives the correct initial hidden state from the encoder. All of this makes the code less concise -- hence the decision to stick with the regular `nn.LSTM`.\n"

It then uses the vocabulary to numericalize the tokens into `ids` and converts these `ids` into a `tensor`, adding a \"fake\" batch dimension, and then passes the `tensor` through the `encoder` to get the `hidden` and `cell` states. We then perform the decoding, starting with the `sos_token`, converting it into a tensor, passing it through the `decoder`, getting the `predicted_token` our model thinks is most likely to be next in the sequence, which we append to our list of `inputs` to the decoder. If the `predicted_token` is the end of sequence token then we stop decoding, if not we continue the loop, using the `predicted_token` as the next input to the decoder. We keep decoding until the decoder outputs the `eos_token` or we hit `max_output_length` (which we use to avoid the decoder just generating tokens forever). Once we've stopped decoding, we convert out inputs into `tokens` using our vocabulary and return them.\n"

In our case, we only have a single reference sentence so we just wrap our target sentence in a list. We also convert our translations from a list of tokens into a string by joining them with whitespace inbetween and getting rid of the `<sos>` and `<eos>` tokens (as they will never appear in our reference sentences).\n"
